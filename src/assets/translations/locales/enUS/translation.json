  "about_p1": "I am a musician at heart, with an artistic spirit and passionate about coding. Having finished my high school years, I have decided that development was the thing that I wanted to do for a living. So I started to study System Analysis and Development at college. The first job that I had was an internship as Technical Support at Positivo University. After a while I left that internship and started on my first job as a developer at Cinq Technologies, where I still work today. At the beginning, I was an intern who worked mainly as a C# developer but, after a few months, I had the opportunity to work in a PoC (Proof of Concept) with Vue.js and React.js. Those PoC made me fall in love with Web Development and JavaScript and also made me be known in the company. Nowadays, I am a Front-end Engineer working mainly with React.js.",
